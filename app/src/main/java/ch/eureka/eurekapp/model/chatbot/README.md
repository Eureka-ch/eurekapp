# Chatbot Implementation

## Technology Choice

This chatbot uses **DeepSeek** for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

### Local LLMs

Local LLMs small enough to run on mobile devices have significant limitations:
- **Context length**: They cannot handle long contexts like meeting transcriptions
- **Overall efficiency**: They lack the performance needed for quality responses
So the decision is to not implement them for the app and to only use API based.

DeepSeek provides a better balance of cost, efficiency, and capability for this use case.
