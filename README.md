# EurekApp
EurekApp is a mobile application that helps students with their studies using artificial intelligence.

## Main features
- Centralization: EurekApp is the only application students need. There is no need to switch between Moodle, edDiscussions, etc. All necessary features and information are contained in this application.
- AI assistant: The application includes a smart AI assistant that answers students' questions without delay. It uses connected information sources such as documents uploaded to Moodle.
- Student collaboration platform: A built-in platform for sharing academic resources helps build community and strengthens the solidarity.

## Technology
- API integration: Information is added to the application via the APIs of individual platforms. The application supports integration with Telegram groups using bots.
- AI: The application uses LLM to provide smart assistant services. Emphasis is placed on minimizing hallucinations to limit the risks associated with learning using AI.

## Advantages
- Higher student productivity: Access to a centralized source of information allows students to devote more time to their studies, thereby increasing productivity. The academic resource sharing platform gives many students access to information that would otherwise be unavailable to them.
- Stress reduction: An up-to-date and accurate overview of current and upcoming study obligations and events increases students' awareness and reduces stress arising from potential disorientation in the flood of information.
- Community building: The platform for sharing academic resources encourages solidarity and helps build friendships.
- Practicality: This application is designed to solve the everyday real-life problems of students. Its goal is to become an integral part of a student's day, just as the CFF application is part of the life of public transport passengers or GitHub is part of the life of programmers.
